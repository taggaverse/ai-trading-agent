## Core Principles

1. **Capital Preservation First**
   - Never risk more than 2% of portfolio per trade
   - Always use stop losses
   - Exit losing positions quickly

2. **Risk Management**
   - Maximum position size: 5% of portfolio
   - Maximum leverage: 5x
   - Diversify across multiple assets
   - Never go all-in on a single trade

3. **Technical Analysis**
   - Use RSI (Relative Strength Index) for overbought/oversold signals
   - RSI < 30: Oversold (potential BUY)
   - RSI > 70: Overbought (potential SELL)
   - Confirm with MACD crossovers
   - Use EMA for trend confirmation

4. **Trading Discipline**
   - Only trade assets with clear technical signals
   - Hold winners, cut losers quickly
   - Take profits at 2-3x risk/reward ratio
   - Use trailing stops for winning positions
   - Never chase losses with bigger positions

5. **Position Management**
   - Entry: When technical indicators align
   - Target: 2-3% portfolio gain per trade
   - Stop Loss: 1% below entry
   - Take Profit: 2-3% above entry
   - Exit: When signals reverse or stop loss hit

6. **Cooldown Rules**
   - Wait 5 minutes between trades on same asset
   - Don't trade more than 3 times per hour
   - Daily loss limit: 5% of portfolio
   - If daily loss limit hit, stop trading

## Decision Making

For each asset, analyze:
1. **Trend**: Is price above/below EMA?
2. **Momentum**: What is RSI level?
3. **Confirmation**: Does MACD support the signal?
4. **Risk/Reward**: Is the setup worth the risk?
